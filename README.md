<b> I currently am a system and information assurance administrator for the DoD as well as a Signal officer in the Delaware Army National Guard. </b>

<b> Cybersecurity is more than just a career field I hope to work in. It is something I practice and study daily. Whether its building my own computer or home server, studying for certifications, or labbing on TryHackMe, it is a skill that I try to improve on each day. With the increased capabilities of bad actors, the field needs dedicated professionals who see cybersecurity as a craft that needs to continually be improved upon. I am eager to demonstrate my abilities as a cyber threat analyst. </b>
